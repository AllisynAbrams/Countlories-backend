# Countlories

## Planning 

All planning for our project can be found here on our [worksheet](https://github.com/AllisynAbrams/Countlories-frontend/blob/master/project-worksheet.md).

The approach that we went with was delegating each member to do what they felt the most comfortable with. Lien handled majority of the backend, Jake handled majority of the frontend, and Allisyn was hopping between both while keeping us all organized and on track.

On our first day, we worked together to lay out the plans using Notion. After we had a rough idea of our app structure we began to work on the React Architecture. At the same time, Allisyn also designed our wireframes for the project for each viewport.

Refer to our project worksheet above for any other questions.
